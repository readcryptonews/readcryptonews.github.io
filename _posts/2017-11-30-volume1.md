# Volume 1

### Hello
I decided to start this newsletter since I often get many questions about the blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Here I will share my thoughts, resources, answers to questions, and interesting links. I want to keep it relatively short and full of easy reading information. So here’s volume #1 it will be very introductory, but someone will learn something.

### Questions
**1. Which exchange should I use and why?**

Personally I use [https://cex.io](https://cex.io). They have their fee schedule listed on their website and when you compare it with others, it’s a fair price. They don’t set crazy limitations and I am yet to have any issues with the exchange being down. A common misconception is “as a Canadian I must use a Canadian Exchange”. Cex is a UK company, Coinbase is a US company, and I have successfully used both exchanges with my Canadian debit card. That brings me to Coinbase. Their user-experience is very nice but their fees seem too high. The biggest take-away here is to do your research: [https://bitcoin.org/en/exchanges](https://bitcoin.org/en/exchanges), and [https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-cryptocurrency-trading-platform](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-cryptocurrency-trading-platform).

**2. What do you think about cryptocurrency X (that isn’t Bitcoin)?**

Most of my crypto-investments are in Ethereum. Almost all cryptocurrencies are a fork of Bitcoin and Ethereum with a bit of a twist. And a lot of cryptocurrencies are built off Ethereum. I would recommend staying with Bitcoin since it has first-mover advantage and Ethereum since it created the first crypto-”App Store.” Otherwise, check out [https://coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com) which has a list of over 1,300+ cryptocurrencies. If you want a higher risk/reward, I would do research into the top 10 or top 20 cryptocurrencies and decide from there. Instagram ripped of Snapchat with Stories and now Snapchat is tanking. Just because Bitcoin and Ethereum are the first movers doesn’t mean another cryptocurrency won’t surpass them. Unfortunately I can’t see into the future.

### Finally
I hope you enjoyed the first issue. Show your friends who you think would be interested in this. Just tell them to open [https://readcryptonews.com](https://readcryptonews.com). If you want to continue the conversation, post your thoughts and questions in the comments section below.

Thank you!
