<h3><a name="altcoins">Alternative coins</a></h3>
<p>If you want to trade altcoins take a look at <a href="https://poloniex.com/" target="_blank">Poloniex</a>, <a href="https://www.binance.com/" target="_blank">Binance<a>, <a href="https://www.exodus.io/" target="_blank">Exodus</a>, and <a href="https://support.bittrex.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003463331" target="_blank">Bittrex</a>. Unfortunately, as of December 15th, Bittrex is <b>not</b> accepting new users. December 19th, 2017 was an extremely volatile day. If you look at the top 10 coins based on percent change; every single one is over 100%.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b><p>Poloniex</b> is an exchange that currently provides 99 different coins.</p></li>
    <li><b><p>Binance</b> is an exchange that currently provides over 200 different coins.</p></li>
    <li><b><p>Exodus</b> is a multi-asset smart-wallet that currently provides 18 different coins and integrates with <a href="https://shapeshift.io/" target="_blank">Shapeshift</a>.</p></li>
    <li><b><p>Bittrex</b> is an exchange that currently provides over 250 different coins.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="litecoin">Litecoin: Message from the Founder</a></h3>
<p>The founder of Litecoin <a href="https://redd.it/7kzw6q" target="_blank">shared this message</a>. To summarize, he has donated/sold all of his Litecoin to prevent further accusations of tweeting about its price or news for personal benefit.</p>

<h3><a name="bitcoinx">Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, etc</a></h3>
<p>Since Bitcoin Cash exploded so high that it <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/our-employee-trading-policy-at-coinbase-1d4e860b7837" target="_blank">shut down Coinbase</a>, I'll explain the differences with the top 3 Bitcoins.</p>
<ol>
    <li><b><p>Bitcoin (BTC)</p></b></li>
    <p>The named brand cryptocurrency, conceptualized by a "<a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>" which is an alias for some unknown person.</p>
    <li><b><p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</p></b></li>
    <p><a href="https://www.bitcoincash.org/#faq" target="_blank">BitcoinCash.org</a> is a fork (copy) of Bitcoin with upgraded consensus rules that allow it to grow and scale better than Bitcoin ðŸ˜…. Which basically means, Bitcoin Cash has a higher transactions per second speed.</p>
    <li><b><p>Bitcoin Gold (BTG)</p></b></li>
    <p><a href="https://bitcoingold.org/faq" target="_blank">BitcoinGold.org</a> is also a fork of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Gold is similar to Bitcoin Cash but the main difference is that it uses a different "Proof of Work" protocol, which makes Bitcoin Gold the easiest Bitcoin to Mine.</p>
