<h3><a name="overview">Overview</a></h3>
<p>
    Below I will provide examples of two different traditional companies, their structure, and how they own your data. Followed by an explanation of the ethos of Bitcoin.
</p>

<h3><a name="banks">Example 1: Banks vs Bitcoin</a></h3>
<p>
    Banks are centralized entities which have control over your account. Only you and the bank has access to your information. Bitcoin is a decentralized banking solution, where everyone has read access to anyone's account. Accounts only provide transaction and balance information. In other words Bitcoin itself does not reveal your identity. Only people with the password (private keys) to the account can move the money.
</p>

<h3><a name="software">Example 2: Software Companies</a></h3>
<p>
    A company such as Facebook hosts all your data within their server farms (which is a fancy phrase for thousands of powerful computers, distributed across the world). You access your Facebook account by providing your email and password credentials. Instead of communicating through a middleman such as Facebook's servers, when you download a Bitcoin wallet, you are downloading the entire contents of Bitcoin’s blockchain (which contains the entire history of all the data).
</p>

<h3><a name="wtf_is_mining">WTF is Mining</a></h3>
<p>
    Bitcoin is decentralized and therefore does not follow traditional software system architecture. <a href="https://readCryptoNews.com/volumes/3#definitions" target="_blank">The blockchain is a distributed ledger</a>, which means that every single person with the Bitcoin blockchain has access to all the transactions that have happened in the entire history of Bitcoin. If someone attempts to do a new transaction (in other words: add a block to the blockchain) then the new block needs to be distributed to everyone and this is where mining comes in. Miners have to review this new block to make sure that a nefarious Bitcoin account isn’t trying to send more Bitcoin than they possibly can. Miner’s do this by solving a problem that is classified as a "one way function." Meaning: to compute the answer takes almost no time at all, but given the answer and trying to compute the question takes a very long time, even with extremely powerful computers. Miners need to do this calculation to verify and add a block to the blockchain. Whoever is the first miner to successfully compute this gets rewarded a small fraction of a Bitcoin. This reward is what incentivizes miners and competition, which helps increase transaction speed.
</p>

<h3><a name="how_to_mine">How to Mine</a></h3>
<p>
    Mining is as simple as buying an ASIC chip (which looks like a hard drive) and plugging it into your computer. Mining as an individual, even with the most powerful ASIC chip possible, is difficult to compete with a group of miners working together to win the block. Given this, the majority of miners join a pool, and if they win, they distribute the reward accordingly. Basically, the more efficient your computer is, the more profit you can make.
