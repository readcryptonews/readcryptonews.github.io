### Questions
**1. <a name="cryptoinvestment">Crypto-Currency or Crypto-Investment?</a>**

Bitcoin is more of a crypto-investment. A currency is something that people want to spend on goods and services. Almost everyone, including myself, is buying Bitcoin (or Ethereum) and holding onto it since it‚Äôs constantly skyrocketing. In my mind that‚Äôs easy money. But it‚Äôs insanely volatile and equally risky. Bitcoin bounces up and down over 25% every couple of days. For example, from Nov. 30th to Dec. 7th it went from $9.3k to $16.5k USD. That‚Äôs a 80%+ change in just one week.

This is why many people are still extremely sceptical and why you hear the term bubble thrown around so much that there‚Äôs an app for it: <a href="https://bitcoinbubbleburst.github.io" target="\_blank">Bitcoinbubbleburst</a>. I believe in the idea of cryptocurrencies but until they become mainstream they will remain volatile. If you have the time and resources ($$), you should try day-trading with it. Steam (the largest video game distribution platform) recently stopped accepting Bitcoin, which they speak about in <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613" target="\_blank">this blog posts</a>.

**2. <a name="nextcoin">What is IOTA and what is the ‚Äúnext big‚Äù coin.</a>**

<a href="IOTA.org" target="\_blank">IOTA</a> is a new cryptocurrency whose name is based off the buzzword ‚ÄúInternet-of-things‚Äù (IoT). It is now #4 under Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash in CoinMarketCap. IOTA‚Äôs value is that all transactions are free. <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/iota-price-drops-co-founder-admits-microsoft-not-partner-participant" target="\_blank">~~They teamed up with tech giants such as Microsoft, Samsung, Fujitsu, and others.~~</a> ~~This gave them a boost and now they‚Äôre the ‚Äúnext big‚Äù coin.~~ Last week as fake news spread, everyone fell for it. Unfortunately this is the world of decentralization, where people can take advantage of heard mentality.

In other **REAL** news: cats! If you like cats, cryptocurrencies, or trading cards, check out my CryptoKitty here: <a href="https://cryptokitties.co/kitty/11431" target="\_blank">cryptokitties.co/kitty/11431</a>. Check out the Cryptokitties homepage <a href="https://cryptokitties.co" target="\_blank">cryptokitties.co</a>. Full disclosure: I know the company/people who created the game. They‚Äôre not paying me for this. I genuinely think it‚Äôs awesome/hilarious. They literally ‚Äúbroke the internet‚Äù meaning: they created so much traffic on the Ethereum network that other businesses using the network were not working.

### Finally
My goal here is to help clarify misconceptions and to teach as much as I can. So if you have any questions feel free to respond and I‚Äôll most likely answer it in the next volume. For the next few volumes I‚Äôm going to create quick tutorials on how to start with Bitcoin and describe some of the basic concepts to help get the uninitiated up to speed. One of which is a short video describing ‚ÄúWTF is Mining‚Äù and I would love some feedback. This form is one question and should take you less than a minute: [https://goo.gl/forms/yunTUGXO1rPkKbm82](https://goo.gl/forms/yunTUGXO1rPkKbm82). If you want to continue the conversation, post your thoughts and questions in the comments section below.

Thank you!
