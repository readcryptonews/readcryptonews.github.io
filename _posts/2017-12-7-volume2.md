If you missed [Volume 1](https://readcryptonews.com/posts/1), the full version is now public. If you enjoy CryptoNews, send this link to your friends [readcryptonews.com](https://readcryptonews.com) it really helps!

### Questions
**1. Crypto-Currency or Crypto-Investment?**

**2. What is IOTA and what is the ‚Äúnext big‚Äù coin.**

### Finally
My goal here is to help clarify misconceptions and to teach as much as I can. So if you have any questions feel free to respond and I‚Äôll most likely answer it in the next volume. For the next few volumes I‚Äôm going to create quick tutorials on how to start with Bitcoin and describe some of the basic concepts to help get the uninitiated up to speed. One of which is a short video describing ‚ÄúWTF is Mining‚Äù and I would love some feedback. This form is one question and should take you less than a minute: [https://goo.gl/forms/yunTUGXO1rPkKbm82](https://goo.gl/forms/yunTUGXO1rPkKbm82). If you want to continue the conversation, post your thoughts and questions in the comments section below.

Thank you!

Bojan
