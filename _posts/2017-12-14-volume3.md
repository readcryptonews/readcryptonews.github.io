### <a name="litecoin">Litecoin and Feedback</a>
From December 7th to the 12th, Litecoin (LTC) has gone from $95 to $400+ which is a 320%+ increase. Altcoins have a lot of potential since their value is not in the thousands of dollars yet. A lot of feedback I have received is questions that follow the pattern: "What is X?" So, at the end of this issue I'll provide analogies for several different concepts.

### <a name="get_bitcoin">How to get Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies</a>
In 2017 "How to buy Bitcoin" was the <a href="https://g.co/trends/bhCXt" target="\_blank">third largest Global search in "How to...".</a> I'll provide you with the answer.

##### Quick overview
1. Choose an exchange
2. Create an account
3. Verify your account
4. Attach a payment method
5. Exchange your cash for crypto
6. More at Changelly & Shapeshift.io

##### Detailed explanation

1. **Choose an exchange**, preferably one that has good history and security practices. For my readers in Canada, these two Canadian exchanges are very popular and reputable according to my sources: <a href="https://QuadrigaCX.com" target="\_blank">QuadrigaCX.com</a> and in beta <a href="https://einstein.exchange" target="\_blank">einstein.exchange</a>.

2. **Create an account**, this is just like any other account, sign up with your email and create a secure password. I recommend using a passphrase such as `ILikeLearningAboutBitcoinItsFun1234!` instead of the same password you use for every other account. Stay safe out there.

3. **Verify your account**, all exchanges require some form of verification. I avoid the ones that ask for a Social Insurance Number. They still require something such as a Driver's License, Passport, Utility Bill, and a Selfie with you holding your Identification.

4. **Attach a payment method**, you will need to attach your VISA/Mastercard/Amex/etc bank card. To verify your card most exchanges will charge you some random number and ask you what that number is. After verification they refund you your money.

5. **Exchange your cash for crypto**, now that you‚Äôre verified you can deposit money from your bank account into your crypto-exchange account. After that you can exchange your cash to a crypto of your choice that your exchange supports.

6. **More at <a href="https://changelly.com/" target="\_blank">Changelly.com</a> & <a href="https://shapeshift.io" target="\_blank">Shapeshift.io</a>**, if your exchange doesn‚Äôt support a cryptocurrency you want to invest in, look into Changelly or Shapeshift. Together they support over eighty different coins/tokens.

### <a name="definitions">Definitions & Analogies</a>

**Blockchain**
The blockchain is an immutable, open, distributed, ledger. Imagine a spreadsheet file that has everyone‚Äôs name linked to everyone‚Äôs bank account balances and everyone has access to this file. An example is the following spreadsheet, where only two people exist in the world: Alice and Bojan. This is block number one in the blockchain.

Bojan can pay Alice $100 and then block two is created and now we have two blocks in the blockchain. Represented below.

You can now image, that it‚Äôs impossible to cheat, and artificially increase your bank account, since everyone else can see your true balance. Once a block is set it cannot be changed.

**Cryptocurrency**
Wikipedia has a great definition which I‚Äôll summarize as ‚Äúa currency that uses a blockchain to do it‚Äôs transactions.‚Äù

**Wallet**
Wallets are software that can store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies. Anyone with the address of the wallet can read its balance, which address each payment came from, and which address each payment is sent to. Here‚Äôs an address with about 119,000 Bitcoin: <a href="https://blockchain.info/address/3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r" target="\_blank">blockchain.info/address/3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r</a>. 119,000 Bitcoin is about $1.9 Billion USD on December 9th 2017.

**Explorer**
An explorer such as blockchain.info is an interface to read transactions and balances of addresses (i.e. wallets).

**Bitcoin**
Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency. There‚Äôs currently more than 1,300 different type of cryptocurrencies. The current top 5 according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" target="\_blank">Coinmarketcap</a> are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA, and Litecoin.

**Token**
A token is exactly like a cryptocurrency but instead of using it as a currency to pay for goods and services it‚Äôs used as a way to pay for one specific service. The analogy: when you go to an arcade you exchange your cash for their tokens to be able to play games. This is basically the exact same thing but instead of physical tokens they are crypto-tokens. An example is <a href="https://status.im/" target="\_blank">Status and the Status Network Token</a>.

**Mining**
I‚Äôm currently creating a video explaining ‚ÄúWTF is Mining.‚Äù Please fill out this one question form if you haven‚Äôt already <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/1v98WAHKruCiJZnI2" target="\_blank">https://goo.gl/forms/1v98WAHKruCiJZnI2</a>. Here‚Äôs a really good two minute explanation <a href="https://youtu.be/GmOzih6I1zs" target="\_blank">https://youtu.be/GmOzih6I1zs</a>.
