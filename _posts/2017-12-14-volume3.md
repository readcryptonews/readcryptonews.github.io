# Volume 3

### Hello

If you missed [Volume 2](https://readcryptonews.com/posts/2/the-next-bitcoin), the full version is now public. If you enjoy CryptoNews, share this link readcryptonews.com. A lot of feedback I have received is that many of my readers don’t know the first thing about cryptocurrencies. So here I’ll be defining a bunch of terms and providing analogies.

### How to get Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies

##### Quick overview
1. Choose an exchange
2. Create an account
3. Verify your account
4. Attach a payment method
5. Exchange your cash for crypto
6. More at Shapeshift.io

##### Detailed explanation

1. **Choose an exchange**, preferably one that has good history and security practices. For my readers in Canada, these two Canadian exchanges are very popular and reputable according to my sources: <a href="https://QuadrigaCX.com" target="\_blank">QuadrigaCX.com</a> and in beta <a href="https://einstein.exchange" target="\_blank">einstein.exchange</a>.

2. **Create an account**, this is just like any other account, sign up with your email and create a secure password. I recommend using a passphrase such as `ILikeLearningAboutBitcoinItsFun1234!` instead of the same password you use for every other account. Stay safe out there.

3. **Verify your account**, all exchanges require some form of verification. I avoid the ones that ask for a Social Insurance Number. They still require something such as a Driver's License, Passport, Utility Bill, and a Selfie with you holding your Identification.

4. **Attach a payment method**, you will need to attach your VISA/Mastercard/Amex/etc bank card. To verify your card most exchanges will charge you some random number and ask you what that number is. After verification they refund you your money.

5. **Exchange your cash for crypto**, now that you’re verified you can deposit money from your bank account into your crypto-exchange account. After that you can exchange your cash to a crypto of your choice that your exchange supports.

6. **More at <a href="https://shapeshift.io" target="_blank">Shapeshift.io</a>**, if your exchange doesn’t support a cryptocurrency you want to invest in, look into Shapeshift they support over sixty different coins.

### Definitions & Analogies

**Blockchain**
The blockchain is an immutable, open, distributed, ledger. Imagine a spreadsheet file that has everyone’s name linked to everyone’s bank account balances and everyone has access to this file. An example is the following spreadsheet, where only two people exist in the world: Alice and Bojan. This example is block number one in the blockchain.

Bojan can pay Alice $100 and then block two is created and now we have two blocks in the blockchain. Represented below.

You can now image, that it’s impossible to cheat, and artificially increase your bank account, since everyone else can see your true balance. Once a block is set it cannot be changed.

**Cryptocurrency**
Wikipedia has a great definition which I’ll summarize as “a currency that uses a blockchain to do it’s transactions.”

**Wallet**
Wallets are software that can store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies. Anyone with the address of the wallet can read its balance, which address each payment came from, and which address each payment is sent to. Here’s an address with about 119,000 Bitcoin: <a href="https://blockchain.info/address/3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r" target="\_blank">blockchain.info/address/3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r</a>. 119,000 Bitcoin is about $1.9 Billion USD on December 9th 2017.

**Bitcoin**
Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency. There’s currently more than 1,300 different type of cryptocurrencies. The current top 5 according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" target="\_blank">Coinmarketcap</a> are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA, and Litecoin.

**Token**
A token is exactly like a cryptocurrency but instead of using it as a currency to pay for goods and services it’s used as a way to pay for one specific service. The analogy: when you go to an arcade you exchange your cash for their tokens to be able to play games. This is basically the exact same thing but instead of physical tokens they are crypto-tokens. An example is <a href="https://status.im/" target="\_blank">Status and the Status Network Token</a>.

**Mining**
I’m currently creating a video explaining “WTF is Mining.” Please fill out this one question form if you haven’t already <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/1v98WAHKruCiJZnI2" target="\_blank">https://goo.gl/forms/1v98WAHKruCiJZnI2</a>. Here’s a really good two minute explanation <a href="https://youtu.be/GmOzih6I1zs" target="\_blank">https://youtu.be/GmOzih6I1zs</a>.
