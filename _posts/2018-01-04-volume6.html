<h3><a name="awesome">Awesome Cryptocurrency ‚≠êÔ∏è</a></h3>
<p>
    There's a trend on Github where people create and regularly update "awesome" lists for topics and I could not find a cryptocurrency list.
    The <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome" target="_blank">Awesome List of Awesome Lists</a> has almost 75,000 stars and I would love to add awesome-cryptocurrency to it.
    So click the star for Awesome Cryptocurrency and help me add it to the popular curated lists repository!

<h3><a name="marketcap">The Total Market Cap üåù</a></h3>
<p>
    The total market capitilization for all cryptocurrency coins and tokens is now greater than 75% of <b>1 Trillion Dollars</b> in USD.
    If you want to trade more coins than boring Bitcoin, join <a href="www.binance.com/?ref=18161980" target="_blank">Binance</a> where you can begin trading tokens immediately.
    Just withdraw Bitcoin or Ethereum from the exchange you currently use into your new Binance account.
    Then have fun with new cryptocurrencies that sometimes see over <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/" target="_blank">100% increase</a>.
    You can thank me later.
