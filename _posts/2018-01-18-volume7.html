    In the world of cryptocurrencies, it's important to be able to react to news very fast.
    For this reason, I created a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2088720031357381/" target="_blank">CryptoNews: Bitcoin for Beginners</a> Facebook group.
    Here I will be answering questions in real time and hopefully building a great crypto-community.
    Join the group and post Hi from the newsletter!

<h3><a name="HODL">Hold On for Dear Life ðŸ¤œðŸ’¢ðŸ¤›</a></h3>
<p>
    In the world of cryptocurrency there's only two emotions:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>FOMO, the Fear Of Missing Out, when the total market value is really high.</li>
    <li>Full Panic Mode, when the total market value is really low.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Something you need to remember is that you technically haven't lost money yet until you sell at a loss.
    That being said, sometimes it's a good idea to cut your losses. For example, on a failed ICO.
    The moral of the story is to be patient. Interestingly enough, <strong>January 15th or 16th</strong> is always the worst day of the entire year for crypto.
